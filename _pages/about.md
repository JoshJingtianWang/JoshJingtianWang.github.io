Hello! I am a molecular biologist-turned-data scientist. I completed my PhD in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at UC Irvine and the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in 2022. I am currently enrolled in the **MS in Data Science program at University of Rochester**. I will graduate in **December 2023** when I will be looking for full time data scientist or machine learning engineer roles.

Feel free to message or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshjingtianwang/).
