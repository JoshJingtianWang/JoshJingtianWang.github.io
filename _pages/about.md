Hello! My name is Josh Wang and I am a molecular biologist-turned-data scientist with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights. My journey began at UC Irvine where I completed my PhD in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, equipping me with an analytical mindset. In 2022, I further refined my skills in data science by completing the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.

Currently, I am pursuing an MS in Data Science at University of Rochester. My expected graduation is in December 2023, after which I am excited to explore full-time opportunities as a data scientist or machine learning engineer.

If you have any questions, opportunities, or simply want to connect, please feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshjingtianwang/).
